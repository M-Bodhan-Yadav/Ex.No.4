## Procedure

### 1. Define the Scenario and Use Case
- **Scenario:**  
  The manufacturing industry seeks to reduce manual monitoring and increase operational efficiency through automation. IoT devices and embedded controllers will automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  
- **Goal:**  
  Streamline production, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.  
- **Target Audience:**  
  Manufacturing companies in sectors such as automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation significantly improves productivity and reduces operational costs.  

### 2. Main Objectives
- Improve production efficiency by **30%** through optimized workflows.  
- Minimize machinery downtime using **predictive maintenance** techniques.  
- Enable **real-time monitoring** and **remote control** of manufacturing systems.  
- Reduce energy consumption by **optimizing operational schedules and machine usage**.  

### 3. Identify and Apply Prompt Patterns

#### a) Idea Generation Prompt
- **Prompt:**  
  “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?”  
- **Generated Ideas:**  
  - Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance  
  - Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures  
  - Energy optimization through automated machine scheduling  
  - Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and reporting  
  - AI analytics for anomaly detection and workflow optimization  

#### b) Persona and Context Prompt
- **Prompt:**  
  “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?”  
- **Generated Context:**  
  - Intuitive interface displaying real-time machine performance, energy usage, and alerts  
  - Reliable and easy-to-use system requiring minimal training  
  - Managers receive actionable insights for planning and resource allocation  
  - Context-aware notifications prioritize critical issues without overwhelming the user  

#### c) Comparative Analysis Prompt
- **Prompt:**  
  “Compare the impact of different IoT-based automation strategies on production efficiency and downtime.”  
- **Generated Insights:**  
  - Predictive maintenance reduces unplanned downtime more effectively than reactive maintenance  
  - Remote monitoring increases decision-making speed and reduces labor dependency  
  - Energy optimization strategies can reduce operational costs by up to 15%  

#### d) Prompt Refinement and Limitations
- Broad prompts produce generic suggestions; refining prompts to specific objectives yields **more relevant and actionable responses**.  
- Limiting prompt size ensures the AI focuses on critical aspects without generating unnecessary output.  

---

## Result
- Various prompt types were successfully executed, producing actionable insights for designing an AI-powered chatbot.  
- The chatbot framework developed can support operators and managers by providing **real-time monitoring, predictive alerts, and energy optimization strategies**.  
- Structured prompts improved idea generation, context understanding, and comparative evaluation.
